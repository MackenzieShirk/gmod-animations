SMD and QC files used to build the Garry's Mod player animation libraries.

Re-uses of this content in other projects (e.g. Source mods) should be attributed to Maxime Lebled, Facepunch Studios LTD / Valve Software.

Contributions are welcome if you know what you're doing! Though I'm mostly sharing this because the level of documentation on obscure QC commands is so low, it's always nicer to have more commented examples to look at.
